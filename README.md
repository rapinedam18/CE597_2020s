# CE597 --- 2020 Spring Class Demos
This is the class demos from CE 597 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Vehicle Operations.



## Course outline

This class will include but not limited to the following topics (and their applications in transportation system and AV operations):

\-    Regression: Linear, 

\-    Classification: Perceptron, SVM, Logistic, Decision Tree.

\-    Model selection: Hyperparameter search, Cross-validation, Learning Curves, AIC, BIC.

\-    Classic data mining methods: Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), Link Analysis and Prediction Heuristics (Link prediction, Missing values), Collaborative Filtering, Dimensionality Reduction.

\-    Improving Weak Models: Ensemble techniques, boosting

\-    Deep Learning: 

​	Artificial neural network

​	Feedforward Networks (activation functions, architectures, generalization, and universal approximators).

​	Backpropagation (chain rule of calculus, vanishing and exploding gradients).

\-    Reinforcement Learning:

​	Q learning (Q table method)

​	Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, Actor-Critic, etc.)
